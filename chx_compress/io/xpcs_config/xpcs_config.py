        Make an hdf5 configuration file from the filename.

        This configuration file is used for the xpcs-eigen library.

        Parameters
        ----------

        filename : the filename of the EIGER master file

        dqmap: 2d np.ndarray
            the dynamic q/phi partitions
            Each partition must contain a unique integer id from 0 to number of
            partitions.
            The mapping from these integer id's back to q/phi or other
            coordinate system is up to the user

        dqmap: 2d np.ndarray
            the static q/phi partitions
            Each partition must contain a unique integer id from 0 to number of
            partitions.
            The mapping from these integer id's back to q/phi or other
            coordinate system is up to the user

        out_filename : the output filename for the hdf5 configuration file

        beg: int, optional
            The beginning frame to analyze

        end: int or None, optional
            The end frame to analyze
            if None, then use the last frame

        stride_frames: int, optional
            skip every nth frame where "n" is the stride_frames
            stride is performed before average

        avg_frames: int, optional
            average every n frames together where "n" is avg_frames
            the striding is performed before the average (see stride_frames)

        delays_per_level: int, optional
            the number of delays per level for the multitau analysis

        eiger_version: the version of the EIGER file format used

        Returns
        -------
        xpcs_config : an XPCS config file
